## Contributing to Teletext-Twitter

### Introduction 

I welcome submissions to the project! I consider the software feature-complete, but bug fixes or code improvements would be good.

### Guidelines

* Please make sure you use 4 spaces for indents instead of tabs.
* I like code comments! If you're doing something interesting, educational or useful with the code please comment away.
* Nice and clean code please, make it somewhat human-readable.

I can be found via email at tehhustler@hotmail.com or on the AsylumNet IRC network as Mark

I'm also on the Facebook Teletext group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/TeletextGroup/
